# Shiny App for Microbiome Analysis

Shiny Application for power and sample size estimation to plan
differential abundance microbiome studies.

The application is currently hosted on both the ShinyApps server from
RStudio 
[at this link](https://fedematt.shinyapps.io/shinyMB/), 
and on the UGent (Biostat department) server 
[at this other link](http://statapps.ugent.be/tools/mbPower/)




Need `msWaldHMP` to work, which can be found 
[at this link](https://github.com/mafed/msWaldHMP)
